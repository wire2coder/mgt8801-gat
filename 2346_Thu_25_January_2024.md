### Financial Ratios
Certainly! The slide lists types of financial ratios, which are like quick health checks for a business:

1. **Liquidity**: Measures if a company can pay its bills on time. Think of it like checking if you have enough in your wallet to cover expenses that are due soon.

2. **Capital Adequacy (Leverage)**: This is about checking if a company is using too much borrowed money compared to its own. It's like making sure you're not using too much of your credit card to pay for things, as opposed to money you actually have.

3. **Asset Quality (Asset Management)**: This checks how well a company is using what it owns to make money. It's like making sure the car you own is being used enough to justify the cost of buying it.

4. **Earnings (Profitability)**: This tells you how good a company is at making money from its normal business activities. It's like looking at your paycheck to see if your job is paying you enough for your work.

These financial checks help people understand if a business is doing well financially or if it might have problems in the future.



"Net income" and "net sales" are both important financial terms, but they represent different aspects of a company's performance:

**Net sales:**

* **Definition:** The total revenue earned by a company from selling its goods or services **minus** any returns, allowances, or discounts. It represents the **top line** of a company's income statement.
* **What it tells you:** Shows the gross amount of money generated through sales, giving a high-level picture of the company's revenue activity.
* **Limitations:** Doesn't take into account the expenses incurred to generate those sales or other operating costs.

**Net income:**

* **Definition:** The profit remaining after **subtracting all expenses** from net sales. It represents the **bottom line** of a company's income statement.
* **What it tells you:** Shows the company's overall profitability, indicating how efficiently it converts sales into profit.
* **Limitations:** While a valuable indicator, doesn't provide details about specific cost categories or reasons for profitability changes.

Here's an analogy:

* **Think of net sales like the total money you earn from your lemonade stand on a given day.**
* **Net income is like the money you have left after subtracting the cost of lemons, sugar, cups, and your time setting up.**

**Key differences:**

* **Scope:** Net sales only consider revenue, while net income considers both revenue and expenses.
* **Focus:** Net sales focus on sales activity, while net income focuses on profitability.
* **Location:** Net sales appear higher on the income statement, while net income appears at the bottom.
