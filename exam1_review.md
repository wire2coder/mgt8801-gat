### Balance sheet: 
(SNAPSHOT) of the financial position of a business on a particular date. It lists the assets, liabilities and owner's equity of the business at a specific point in time.

##### Asset = Liability + Owner's Equity


##### Current assets:
'stuff' that are expected to be converted to cash or consume within ONE year.
- cash
- accounts receivable
- inventory
- prepaid expenses

##### Non-current (long term asset) assets:
'stuff' that are expected to provide 'economic benefit' for more than ONE year.
They include:
###### TANGIBLE ASSETS
land, buildings, and machinery, and 
###### INTANGIBLE ASSETS
- patents
- trademarks
- copyrights
- 'goodwill' (this one is litterally stupid) is so named because it represents the favorable qualities of a business that make it more valuable than just the sum of its tangible assets and liabilities. These qualities are often hard to quantify but can significantly impact a company's ability to generate future profits.



#### Liabilities:
##### Current liabilities:
'money obligations' that are expected to be paid within ONE year.
- deferred revenue (unearned revenue), money received, but goods or service has not been delivered yet.
- accounts payable
- credit card debt
- short-term loans

##### Non-current (long term liability) liabilities:
'money obligations' that are expected to be paid in MORE THAN ONE year.
- long-term loans
- bonds PAYABLE
- mortgages

##### Contingent liabilities: (important?)


#### SHARE holders' Equity:
- Capital stock (common stock), money received from selling shares of stock.
- Retained earnings
-- Dividends, money paid to shareholders. ( this will DECREASE the retained earnings)
- Tresury stock, (a 'deduction') ?


### Income statement: 
(PERIOD OF TIME) a financial statement that reports a company's financial performance over a specific accounting PERIOD OF TIME. Financial performance is assessed by giving a summary of how the business incurs its revenues and expenses through both operating and non-operating activities.

- Operating activities: 

    CASH flow from 'primary activities' of a business such as selling products and services.

  - Revenue
  - Cost of goods sold (COGS)
  - Gross profit
  - Operating expenses
  - Operating income

- Investing activities:

    CASH flow from buying or selling 'long-term assets' and investments.
    'investments' are buying or selling stocks, bonds, and stakes in other companies 
    that are not considered 'cash equivalents'.

    The CASH used to purchase or received from selling these assets is recorded under investing activities.

  - Purchase of long-term assets
  - Sale of long-term assets
  - Purchase of investments
  - Sale of investments

- Financing activities:

    'CASH flow' related to borrowing and repaying money, issued stocks, and paying dividends.

    Unlike borrowing money (taking on debt), issuing stock doesn't require the company to repay the capital to the investors. Instead, shareholders have a claim on future profits and assets of the company.

    - Issuance of stock
    - Repurchase of stock
    - Issuance of debt (bonds)
    - Repayment of debt (bonds)
    - Payment of dividends


- Bad Debt Expense (income statement)
  Money that you will not be able to collect from your customers.
  -- you DO NOT reduce 'net sales'
  -- you record 'bad debt expense' on the income statement
  -- do not 'carry over' to the next year, for 'this year' only

- 'Allowance Method' for 'bad debt expense' (contra-asset account) meaning something that does the 'opposite'
  
    

### Cash flow statement:
(PERIOD OF TIME) a financial statement that provides aggregate data regarding all cash inflows a company receives from its ongoing operations and external investment sources, as well as all cash outflows that pay for business activities and investments during a given period.

## Accural accounting: 
Accrual accounting is an accounting method that matching revenues to expenses (the matching principle) at the time in which the transaction occurs rather than when payment is made (or received). 

## Matching principle: 
The matching principle is an accounting concept that seeks to tie revenue generated in an accounting period to the expenses incurred to generate that revenue. In other words, the matching principle states that businesses must record expenses in the same accounting period as the revenues they are related to.

## Revenue recognition principle:


## Revenue: 
the money you get a sale without any expenses taken out yet.

## Cost of goods sold (COGS) 
is the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.



## Contra-Accounts: 
are a type of accounting account used to record adjustments to another account. They have a balance that is opposite to the normal balance of the associated account. This means if the related account normally has a debit balance, the contra account will have a credit balance, and vice versa.

### The Cost Principle (historical cost principle)
assets and liabilities should be recorded at their original purchase price.
the 'cost' is the amount paid or the value at the time of acquisition.

 if a company buys a piece of equipment for $50,000, it will be recorded at $50,000 in the company's books, regardless of its current market value.

 ### 'An unqualified opinion' ('good' clean opinion) very confusing language
 When the auditor states that the financial statements are "presented fairly," it does not mean that the statements are absolutely accurate in every detail. Instead, it means that the financial statements provide a true and fair view of the company's financial position and performance


 ### 'Going concern' assumption
  The going concern assumption states that businesses should be treated as if they will continue to operate indefinitely or at least long enough to meet their commitments and obligations. This assumption allows businesses to defer the recognition of certain expenses until a later date. For example, a business may purchase a piece of equipment that will last for 10 years. The business will record the cost of the equipment as an asset and then depreciate the asset over its useful life. The business will not record the entire cost of the equipment as an expense in the year of purchase. Instead, the business will record a portion of the cost as an expense each year for 10 years. The going concern assumption allows the business to spread the cost of the equipment over its useful life.


### OPINION on Financial Statements:

- Purpose: To express an opinion on the financial statements themselves at a specific point in time. It's the result of the audit process where the auditor has examined the numbers and disclosures in the financial statements to ensure they are in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework (like GAAP or IFRS).
    
- Scope: This opinion focuses on the end product, which is the financial statements, and whether they accurately reflect the company's financial status as of the date of the statements.

### OPINION on Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

- Purpose: To evaluate and express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting throughout the period being audited. This is about the process that leads to the creation of the financial statements.

Most 'expenses' do not have related revenue???
If 'expenses' do not have related revenue,
then 'costs' are reported as 'expenses' in
THE TIME PERIOD that benefit from the 'costs'.

'balance sheet ACCOUNTS' are 'permanent' accounts.
because they 'carry over' from end of december 2023 to january 2024

'Income statement ACCOUNTS' are 'temporary' accounts.
because they DO NOT 'carry over' from end of december 2023 to january 2024
(one year to the next year)
because you want to see the 'performance' for just THAT 'time period'.
you don't the expenses from last year to be mixed with this year's expenses.

what calculation was made to obtain the 2018 Diluted Earnings per Share of $9.73?
Fiscal year 2018
net earnings of $11,121 (in millions) / weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding of 1,142 (in millions) = $9.73
we are 'dividing money'

time stamp, 1:24:35
as soon as the bord of directors 'declares' the dividend, 
it get deducted from the 'retained earnings' account.
it becomes a 'liability'.

"we evaludate the inventory valued using a cost method at the ned of each quarter to ensure that it is carraied at the lower
of cost or net realizable value. The valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a  'cost method' was not "material" to our consolidated financial statements at the ned of fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017."

### Balance Sheet 'accounts'
-- balance 'carry over' from one year to the next year

## week 2, zoom lecture 2

Luther Inc has 10,000 shares of 8%, $50 par value, cumulative preferred stock and 50,000 shares of $1 par value common stock outstanding at December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2017. The board of directors declared and paid a 3,000 dividend in 2016, in 2017, $12,000 of dividends are declared and paid. What are the dividends received by the common stockholders in 2017?


'par value' (something very low) $0.01 or $1
company can sell HIGHER than the 'par value' 
for example $10 per share, so that means 'paid in capital in excess of par value' is $9 (10 - 1) per share.

Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par: This account on the balance sheet captures that excess amount. If the company sells 1,000 shares at $10, with a par value of $1, the "Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par" would be $9,000 (1,000 shares * $9 excess per share).


Question 10
If bonds are issued at a premium, the stated interest rate is:
Group of answer choices

Higher than the market rate of interest

Lower than the market rate of interest

Too low to attract investors

Adjusted to a higher rate of interest

Zero

issued at 'premium' means 'higher than the face value'
why would someone pay the 'extra' money?
because the 'interest rate' of the bond is (stated interest rate)
HIGHER than the 'market rate of interest'.

that's why people will pay more for the 'bond' so the boud will 'pay them back more'

### "subsidiary"
A "subsidiary" is a company that is controlled by another company, known as the parent company or holding company. Control is typically achieved through ownership of more than 50% of the subsidiary's voting stock. Here are some key points:

    Ownership: A subsidiary is owned by another company, which holds the majority of its stock. If the parent company owns 100% of the shares, the subsidiary is termed a "wholly owned subsidiary."


### direct write-off method
The direct write-off method for uncollectible accounts is an accounting approach used to handle bad debts (accounts receivable that are no longer considered collectible). Among the options provided, the statement that best describes the direct write-off method is:

**Is inconsistent with the matching principle.**

Here's why:

- **Inconsistency with the Matching Principle**: The matching principle in accounting states that expenses should be recorded in the same period as the revenues they helped generate. The direct write-off method records bad debt expense only at the time the specific account is deemed uncollectible, which could be a different period from when the related revenue was recognized. This approach can distort the true financial picture of a company for a particular period.

- **Not Using Aging or Credit Sales Method**: The direct write-off method does not estimate bad debts based on aging of accounts receivable or a percentage of credit sales, which are characteristics of the allowance method.

- **Not Using a Contra-Revenue Account**: The direct write-off method does not use a contra-revenue account. It directly writes off the bad debt against the accounts receivable.

In essence, while the direct write-off method is straightforward and used for tax purposes or by smaller businesses, it is not favored under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for larger, publicly traded companies due to its inconsistency with the matching principle.



1. **Uses the Aging Method**:
   - This is a way to guess how much money from sales on credit you might not collect. You look at how long each bill has been waiting to be paid and guess that the longer it's been, the less likely you are to get the money.

2. **Uses the Credit Sales Method**:
   - This is another way to estimate how much money from sales on credit won't be paid. Instead of looking at each bill, you take a percentage of your total sales made on credit, based on past experiences, to figure out the likely bad debts.

3. **Matches the Expense of Uncollectible Accounts with the Related Revenues**:
   - This idea says you should record the cost of not getting paid (bad debts) in the same period you made the sales. It's about matching the cost of doing business (like not getting paid sometimes) with the money you made from selling things.

4. **Uses Contra-Revenue Account to Write Off Uncollectible Receivables**:
   - A contra-revenue account is like a negative sales account. When you realize you're definitely not getting paid for a sale you made earlier, you use this account to say, "Okay, we thought we made this much in sales, but we need to reduce that amount because we're not getting all that money."

5. **Is Inconsistent with the Matching Principle**:
   - The matching principle is an accounting rule that says you should record expenses in the same period as the revenues they help to generate. If you don't follow this rule (like recording bad debts only when you're sure you won't get paid, which could be much later), it's considered inconsistent with this principle. This can make your financial situation in any given period look better or worse than it really is.


Preferred shareholders do not typically have a direct claim on the retained earnings of a company. Retained earnings are primarily associated with common shareholders. Here's how it works:

1. **Retained Earnings**: These are the profits that a company chooses to keep and reinvest in the business rather than distribute as dividends. Retained earnings are part of the equity of the company and are essentially owned by the shareholders.

2. **Common Shareholders**: Common shareholders have a residual claim on the company's assets, which includes retained earnings. This means that after all liabilities and preferred shareholders' claims are satisfied, common shareholders are entitled to the remaining assets, including retained earnings.

3. **Preferred Shareholders**: Preferred shareholders have a priority claim over common shareholders when it comes to dividends and assets in the event of liquidation. However, their claim is typically limited to the fixed dividends and the par value of their shares. They don't usually have a claim on the retained earnings beyond their fixed dividend rights. Retained earnings are generally considered to benefit common shareholders, who take on more risk and have a residual claim on the company's assets.

In essence, while preferred shareholders have priority over common shareholders in certain respects (like receiving dividends and claims in liquidation), retained earnings are primarily linked to the interests of common shareholders.


"Notes Payable" and "Bonds Payable" are both forms of debt that companies can use to raise capital, but they have some distinct differences:

1. **Notes Payable**:
   - **Nature**: Notes payable are usually shorter-term debt instruments. They can be used for various purposes like financing routine business operations or managing working capital.
   - **Maturity**: They typically have a maturity of less than one year, though they can sometimes extend to a few years.
   - **Formal Agreement**: The terms are usually less formal than bonds and are often arranged with banks or financial institutions.
   - **Interest and Repayment**: Notes payable generally have a fixed interest rate and are paid back, along with interest, at maturity or over the term of the note.

2. **Bonds Payable**:
   - **Nature**: Bonds payable are a form of long-term debt and are used for significant capital projects or long-term financing needs.
   - **Maturity**: They usually have a maturity period of more than one year, often extending to 10 years or more.
   - **Issuance**: Bonds are issued to the general public and can be traded on the bond market. Issuing bonds is a more formal process and involves more legal and regulatory requirements.
   - **Interest and Repayment**: Bonds typically pay periodic interest, known as coupon payments, and repay the principal amount (face value) at the end of the bond's term.

In summary, notes payable are generally shorter-term, less formal debt instruments compared to bonds payable, which are longer-term, involve more formal issuance processes, and are often traded in public markets.


Accumulated depreciation is an accounting term used to represent the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recorded against a fixed asset over its life to date. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Depreciation**: This is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. It's an accounting method to account for the wear and tear, deterioration, or obsolescence of the asset.

2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:
   - It is a contra asset account, meaning it offsets the asset account against which it is recorded.
   - Over time, as depreciation expense is recorded each accounting period (year, month, etc.), it accumulates in this account.
   - The balance in the accumulated depreciation account increases by the amount of depreciation expense recorded in each period.

3. **Purpose**:
   - The purpose is to reflect the reduction in value of a fixed asset over time.
   - It provides a more accurate picture of the asset's value on the balance sheet.

4. **Calculation on the Balance Sheet**:
   - On the balance sheet, the original cost of the asset is listed along with the accumulated depreciation.
   - The net book value of the asset is then calculated as: Original Cost of the Asset - Accumulated Depreciation.
   - This net book value represents the current value of the asset as per the company’s books.

5. **Example**: 
   - If a company buys a machine for $10,000 and the annual depreciation expense is $1,000, after three years, the accumulated depreciation will be $3,000. The net book value of the machine at that point would be $10,000 (cost) - $3,000 (accumulated depreciation) = $7,000.

Accumulated depreciation thus helps in understanding how much of an asset's cost has been used up at any point in its life.


"Allowance for Doubtful Accounts" of $7,320 is not an operating expense listed on the income statement, but rather a contra asset account listed on the balance sheet. Let's break down its role:

1. **Contra Asset Account**:
   - "Allowance for Doubtful Accounts" is a contra asset because it decreases the total value of accounts receivable. It represents the estimated amount of accounts receivable that the company does not expect to collect.
   - It's shown on the balance sheet as a deduction from the gross accounts receivable to reflect a more accurate value of what's actually expected to be collected.

2. **Not an Expense on Income Statement**:
   - The creation or adjustment of the allowance for doubtful accounts itself is not directly listed as an operating expense on the income statement. 
   - However, the expense related to creating or increasing this allowance is recorded on the income statement as "Bad Debt Expense" or "Doubtful Accounts Expense." This expense reflects the estimated cost of accounts receivable that are not expected to be collected.

3. **Reflecting on Financial Statements**:
   - When a company estimates that some of its accounts receivable won't be collected, it records this expense on the income statement. 
   - Concurrently, it increases the "Allowance for Doubtful Accounts" by the same amount on the balance sheet. This increase offsets the accounts receivable balance.

In summary, while "Allowance for Doubtful Accounts" is related to an expense (bad debt expense) that is reported on the income statement, the allowance itself is a contra asset account on the balance sheet, used to reduce the gross accounts receivable to their net realizable value.



Net income is directly related to retained earnings in a company's financial accounting. Here's how it works:

1. **Retained Earnings**: This is the cumulative amount of net income that a company has retained (not distributed to shareholders as dividends) over its entire existence. Retained earnings increase when the company earns a profit (net income) and decrease when the company distributes dividends.

2. **Calculating Net Income Using Retained Earnings**:
   - The change in retained earnings over an accounting period is influenced by two factors: the net income for the period and the dividends paid out.
   - If you know the beginning and ending retained earnings and the dividends paid, you can calculate the net income for the period.

3. **Formula**: 
   - Net Income = Ending Retained Earnings - Beginning Retained Earnings + Dividends Paid

Given your data:
- Beginning Retained Earnings = $125,000
- Ending Retained Earnings = $137,000
- Dividends Paid = $16,000

Now, let's calculate the net income for the year.

Let's calculate the net income for the year manually using the provided data:

Net Income = Ending Retained Earnings - Beginning Retained Earnings + Dividends Paid
Net Income = $137,000 (Ending Retained Earnings) - $125,000 (Beginning Retained Earnings) + $16,000 (Dividends Paid)
Net Income = $137,000 - $125,000 + $16,000
Net Income = $28,000

So, the amount of net income for the year was $28,000. This is how net income relates to retained earnings: the company started with $125,000 in retained earnings, earned $28,000 in net income, paid out $16,000 in dividends, and ended with $137,000 in retained earnings.


When a company purchases a significant but not controlling interest in another company, such as 25% of the common stock of an investee, the appropriate method of accounting for this investment is usually **the equity method**. Here's why:

1. **The Equity Method**:
   - This method is used when the investor has significant influence over the investee but does not have full control (typically interpreted as owning 20% to 50% of the voting stock).
   - Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the investor's share of the investee's profits or losses. Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.

2. **Other Methods**:
   - **The Cost Method**: This is used when the investment does not grant the investor significant influence over the investee, typically when the investment is less than 20%.
   - **Consolidated Financial Statements**: These are prepared when the investor has control over the investee, generally interpreted as owning more than 50% of the voting stock.
   - **Controlling Interest Method**: Similar to consolidation, this is used when there is control over the investee.
   - **Determined by Agreement with Other Stockholders**: This is not a standard accounting practice for determining the method of accounting for an investment.

Since the investment in your scenario is 25%, which usually implies significant influence but not control, the equity method is the most appropriate accounting method.
