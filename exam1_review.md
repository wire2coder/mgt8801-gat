- Accural accounting: Accrual accounting is an accounting method that matching revenues to expenses (the matching principle) at the time in which the transaction occurs rather than when payment is made (or received). 

- Matching principle: The matching principle is an accounting concept that seeks to tie revenue generated in an accounting period to the expenses incurred to generate that revenue. In other words, the matching principle states that businesses must record expenses in the same accounting period as the revenues they are related to.

- accounts receivable:  Accounts Receivable is an asset account on the balance sheet. represents money that is owed to the business by its customers for goods or services that have been delivered or used but not yet paid for.

- Revenue: is the total amount of money earned by a business for selling its goods or services. It's recognized when the sale occurs, not necessarily when the payment is received. Revenue is recorded on the income statement 

- Revenue: the money you get a sale without any expenses taken out yet.

- Cost of goods sold (COGS): is the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.

- Deferred revenue: is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. That is, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As the amount of deferred revenue is reduced, it is recognized as revenue on the income statement.

- Contra-Accounts: are a type of accounting account used to record adjustments to another account. They have a balance that is opposite to the normal balance of the associated account. This means if the related account normally has a debit balance, the contra account will have a credit balance, and vice versa.

### The Cost Principle (historical cost principle)
assets and liabilities should be recorded at their original purchase price.
the 'cost' is the amount paid or the value at the time of acquisition.

 if a company buys a piece of equipment for $50,000, it will be recorded at $50,000 in the company's books, regardless of its current market value.
