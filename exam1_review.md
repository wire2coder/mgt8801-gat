### Income statement:

  - Revenue
  - Cost of goods sold (COGS)
  - Gross profit
  - Operating expenses
  - Operating income

- Investing activities:

    CASH flow from buying or selling 'long-term assets' and investments.
    'investments' are buying or selling stocks, bonds, and stakes in other companies

    The CASH used to purchase or received from selling these assets is recorded under investing activities.

  - Sale of investments

- Financing activities:

    'CASH flow' related to borrowing and repaying money, issued stocks, and paying dividends.

    - Repurchase of stock
    - Issuance of debt (bonds)
    - Repayment of debt (bonds)
    - Payment of dividends



### Cash flow statement:
(PERIOD OF TIME) a financial statement that provides aggregate data regarding all cash inflows a company receives from its ongoing operations and external investment sources, as well as all cash outflows that pay for business activities and investments during a given period.

## Accural accounting: 
Accrual accounting is an accounting method that matching revenues to expenses (the matching principle) at the time in which the transaction occurs rather than when payment is made (or received). 

## Matching principle: 
The matching principle is an accounting concept that seeks to tie revenue generated in an accounting period to the expenses incurred to generate that revenue. In other words, the matching principle states that businesses must record expenses in the same accounting period as the revenues they are related to.



## Revenue: 
the money you get a sale without any expenses taken out yet.

## Cost of goods sold (COGS) 
is the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.



## Contra-Accounts: 
are a type of accounting account used to record adjustments to another account. They have a balance that is opposite to the normal balance of the associated account. This means if the related account normally has a debit balance, the contra account will have a credit balance, and vice versa.

### The Cost Principle (historical cost principle)
assets and liabilities should be recorded at their original purchase price.
the 'cost' is the amount paid or the value at the time of acquisition.

 if a company buys a piece of equipment for $50,000, it will be recorded at $50,000 in the company's books, regardless of its current market value.

 ### 'An unqualified opinion' ('good' clean opinion) very confusing language
 When the auditor states that the financial statements are "presented fairly," it does not mean that the statements are absolutely accurate in every detail. Instead, it means that the financial statements provide a true and fair view of the company's financial position and performance
