### Balance sheet: 
(SNAPSHOT) of the financial position of a business on a particular date. It lists the assets, liabilities and owner's equity of the business at a specific point in time.

##### Asset = Liability + Owner's Equity


##### Current assets:
'stuff' that are expected to be converted to cash or consume within ONE year.
- cash
- accounts receivable
- inventory
- prepaid expenses (current asset)

##### Non-current (long term asset) assets:
'stuff' that are expected to provide 'economic benefit' for more than ONE year.
They include:
###### TANGIBLE ASSETS
land, buildings, and machinery, and 
###### INTANGIBLE ASSETS
- patents
- trademarks
- copyrights
- 'goodwill' (this one is litterally stupid) is so named because it represents the favorable qualities of a business that make it more valuable than just the sum of its tangible assets and liabilities. These qualities are often hard to quantify but can significantly impact a company's ability to generate future profits.



#### Liabilities:
##### Current liabilities:
'money obligations' that are expected to be paid within ONE year.
- deferred revenue (unearned revenue), money received, but goods or service has not been delivered yet.
- accounts payable
- credit card debt
- short-term loans

##### Non-current (long term liability) liabilities:
'money obligations' that are expected to be paid in MORE THAN ONE year.
- long-term loans
- bonds PAYABLE
- mortgages

##### Contingent liabilities: (important?)


#### SHARE holders' Equity:
- Capital stock (common stock), money received from selling shares of stock.
- Retained earnings
-- Dividends, money paid to shareholders. ( this will DECREASE the retained earnings)
- Tresury stock, (a 'deduction') ?


### Income statement: 
(PERIOD OF TIME) a financial statement that reports a company's financial performance over a specific accounting PERIOD OF TIME. Financial performance is assessed by giving a summary of how the business incurs its revenues and expenses through both operating and non-operating activities.

- Operating activities: 

    CASH flow from 'primary activities' of a business such as selling products and services.

  - Revenue
  - Cost of goods sold (COGS)
  - Gross profit
  - Operating expenses
  - Operating income

- Investing activities:

    CASH flow from buying or selling 'long-term assets' and investments.
    'investments' are buying or selling stocks, bonds, and stakes in other companies 
    that are not considered 'cash equivalents'.

    The CASH used to purchase or received from selling these assets is recorded under investing activities.

  - Purchase of long-term assets
  - Sale of long-term assets
  - Purchase of investments
  - Sale of investments

- Financing activities:

    'CASH flow' related to borrowing and repaying money, issued stocks, and paying dividends.

    Unlike borrowing money (taking on debt), issuing stock doesn't require the company to repay the capital to the investors. Instead, shareholders have a claim on future profits and assets of the company.

    - Issuance of stock
    - Repurchase of stock
    - Issuance of debt (bonds)
    - Repayment of debt (bonds)
    - Payment of dividends



### Cash flow statement:
(PERIOD OF TIME) a financial statement that provides aggregate data regarding all cash inflows a company receives from its ongoing operations and external investment sources, as well as all cash outflows that pay for business activities and investments during a given period.

## Accural accounting: 
Accrual accounting is an accounting method that matching revenues to expenses (the matching principle) at the time in which the transaction occurs rather than when payment is made (or received). 

## Matching principle: 
The matching principle is an accounting concept that seeks to tie revenue generated in an accounting period to the expenses incurred to generate that revenue. In other words, the matching principle states that businesses must record expenses in the same accounting period as the revenues they are related to.

## Revenue recognition principle:


## Revenue: 
the money you get a sale without any expenses taken out yet.

## Cost of goods sold (COGS) 
is the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.



## Contra-Accounts: 
are a type of accounting account used to record adjustments to another account. They have a balance that is opposite to the normal balance of the associated account. This means if the related account normally has a debit balance, the contra account will have a credit balance, and vice versa.

### The Cost Principle (historical cost principle)
assets and liabilities should be recorded at their original purchase price.
the 'cost' is the amount paid or the value at the time of acquisition.

 if a company buys a piece of equipment for $50,000, it will be recorded at $50,000 in the company's books, regardless of its current market value.

 ### 'An unqualified opinion' ('good' clean opinion) very confusing language
 When the auditor states that the financial statements are "presented fairly," it does not mean that the statements are absolutely accurate in every detail. Instead, it means that the financial statements provide a true and fair view of the company's financial position and performance


 ### 'Going concern' assumption
  The going concern assumption states that businesses should be treated as if they will continue to operate indefinitely or at least long enough to meet their commitments and obligations. This assumption allows businesses to defer the recognition of certain expenses until a later date. For example, a business may purchase a piece of equipment that will last for 10 years. The business will record the cost of the equipment as an asset and then depreciate the asset over its useful life. The business will not record the entire cost of the equipment as an expense in the year of purchase. Instead, the business will record a portion of the cost as an expense each year for 10 years. The going concern assumption allows the business to spread the cost of the equipment over its useful life.


### OPINION on Financial Statements:

- Purpose: To express an opinion on the financial statements themselves at a specific point in time. It's the result of the audit process where the auditor has examined the numbers and disclosures in the financial statements to ensure they are in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework (like GAAP or IFRS).
    
- Scope: This opinion focuses on the end product, which is the financial statements, and whether they accurately reflect the company's financial status as of the date of the statements.

### OPINION on Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

- Purpose: To evaluate and express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting throughout the period being audited. This is about the process that leads to the creation of the financial statements.

### Module 1: Zoom Lecture
## The 'Matching Principle' (Accrual Accounting)
time stamp, 43:18
Most 'expenses' do not have related revenue???
If 'expenses' do not have related revenue,
then 'costs' are reported as 'expenses' in
THE TIME PERIOD that benefit from the 'costs'.

'balance sheet ACCOUNTS' are 'permanent' accounts.
because they 'carry over' from end of december 2023 to january 2024

'Income statement ACCOUNTS' are 'temporary' accounts.
because they DO NOT 'carry over' from end of december 2023 to january 2024
(one year to the next year)
because you want to see the 'performance' for just THAT 'time period'.
you don't the expenses from last year to be mixed with this year's expenses.


'dividend revenue' why is it not an asset???

'Statement of Cash Flows'

'cash flow statment'
- 'direct method'

Home Depot Assignment

what calculation was made to obtain the 2018 Diluted Earnings per Share of $9.73?
Fiscal year 2018
net earnings of $11,121 (in millions) / weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding of 1,142 (in millions) = $9.73
we are 'dividing money'

time stamp, 1:24:35
as soon as the bord of directors 'declares' the dividend, 
it get deducted from the 'retained earnings' account.
it becomes a 'liability'.

"we evaludate the inventory valued using a cost method at the ned of each quarter to ensure that it is carraied at the lower
of cost or net realizable value. The valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a  'cost method' was not "material" to our consolidated financial statements at the ned of fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017."
