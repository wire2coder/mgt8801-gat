## week 1, supply chain management
responsive supply chain:
use MORE money (respond to changes quicker)

efficient supply chain:
use less money (efficient) 

decentralized supply chain:
don't have 1 cenral warehouse to keep stuff
advantages

centralized supply chain:

advantages

Outsourced (to someone else) Supply Chain: 
Means you hire another company to do the work for you. This could be anything from manufacturing products, handling logistics, or customer service. The key is that another business, not your own, takes on these tasks

(moving) Offshored Supply Chain: 
Means your company is still responsible for the work, but it's done in a different country to take advantage of benefits like lower labor costs, favorable tax conditions, or other economic advantages.

PULL system



Lead time 
is the period between the initiation of a process and its completion. In the context of supply chains and business, lead time typically refers to the time from when an order is placed until it is received and ready for use or sale. It includes the time taken for production, processing, and shipping


"low distribution cost per ITEM weight"


"Many points of sale" 
typically refers to the locations where the final transaction with the customer takes place, where the goods are actually sold and change ownership. This would include retail stores, online storefronts, kiosks, or any end-point sales locations.

"Warehouses", on the other hand, are NOT considered points of sale. They are part of the distribution network where goods are stored and managed before being sent to the points of sale. 

"customized delivery"
is like amazon prime 'next day shipping'


"Customized delivery" refers to tailoring the delivery process to meet specific needs or preferences of customers. It's like giving a personal touch to how products are shipped and delivered. Here’s what it typically involves:

1. **Delivery Timing**: Allowing customers to choose when they receive their goods, like scheduling a specific date and time.
2. **Packaging**: Offering gift wrapping or special packaging options for special occasions or for product protection.
3. **Handling Instructions**: Following particular instructions for handling sensitive items, like keeping them upright or at a certain temperature.
4. **Unpacking and Installation**: Providing services to unpack and set up products, such as electronics or furniture.
5. **Direct Communication**: Updating customers with personalized messages about their delivery status.

The main idea is to give customers more control over the delivery of their purchases and make the experience better for them.


to have an 'efficient supply chain' means
you are using as a little money as possible from making the products to sending the products 'to the selling locations'?

i get it now, because a 'customized delivery' would cost more money to 'ship'
because you have to do 'something unique' for each delivery, compare to 'standard delivery' where every deliveries are treated the same

'captive'
The question is asking about the factors that impact the cost when a company is considering moving some of its operations to another country (offshoring), specifically when these operations are not "captive."

When we say offshoring that is "not captive," we're talking about using third-party vendors or facilities in the other country, rather than setting up your own (which would be captive offshoring).


A "functional product" in supply chain and marketing terms refers to a product with stable demand and long life cycles. These products are typically necessities that people buy on a regular basis, like toothpaste, basic clothing, or paper towels. The demand for these products doesn't change much over time, and they don't often go through rapid innovation or style changes.

Given this definition, let's look at the options provided:

1. **High demand uncertainty**: This would not be characteristic of a functional product since their demand is stable.
   
2. **High product variety and low volume**: Functional products usually have low variety and high volume because they are regularly consumed staples.
   
3. **Short product life**: Functional products tend to have long product lives; they are the opposite of trendy or fashionable items that have short life spans due to changing consumer preferences.
   
4. **Low inventory costs**: This is likely to be true for functional products because their stable demand allows for consistent production schedules and efficient inventory management.
   
5. **Long lead times**: Functional products typically don't have long lead times because their stable demand allows for better planning and supply chain optimization.



A "pull system" is a strategy used in production and inventory management where goods are only made or ordered when there's a demand for them. 

Imagine you're in a cafe that only starts to make a sandwich when a customer orders it, instead of making a bunch of sandwiches in the morning and hoping they all sell. The "pull" comes from the customer's order, which triggers the making of the sandwich.

So, in simple words, a pull system means "make or get what's needed, when it's needed, and in the amount needed, based on customer demand." It helps to reduce waste and inventory costs because you're not making products that might not get sold.

ROP (Reorder Point) and Safety Stocks are two important concepts in inventory management used to ensure that a company has the right amount of stock to meet customer demand without overstocking, which can increase costs.

### Reorder Point (ROP)

The **Reorder Point** is the level of inventory that triggers an action to replenish that particular inventory stock. It is calculated to ensure that the stock on hand during the lead time is sufficient to meet expected demand. The lead time is the time between placing an order and receiving the inventory. 

**How it works:**
1. **Calculate the average daily usage** of the inventory item.
2. **Determine the lead time** in days for ordering and receiving the item.
3. Multiply the average daily usage by the lead time to determine the ROP.

**Formula:** ROP = Average Daily Demand × Lead Time

For example, if your average daily demand for a product is 10 units and the lead time to reorder and receive the product is 5 days, the ROP would be 50 units. This means when your inventory level drops to 50 units, it's time to reorder.

### Safety Stock

**Safety Stock** is extra inventory held to guard against uncertainty in demand and supply. It's a buffer of stock that ensures you don't run out of products if demand spikes unexpectedly or if there's a delay in receiving new stock.

**How it works:**
1. **Estimate the maximum potential demand** during the lead time.
2. **Estimate the average demand** during the lead time.
3. The difference between these demands, considering variability and lead time, helps in determining the safety stock level.

**Simple Formula:** Safety Stock = (Maximum daily usage × Lead time) - (Average daily usage × Lead time)

The actual calculation can be more complex, taking into account the variability of demand and lead time, using statistical methods for more accurate results.

**Example:** If the maximum daily usage is 15 units and the average daily usage is 10 units, with a lead time of 5 days, the safety stock would be calculated as follows: (15 × 5) - (10 × 5) = 25 units. This means you should keep an extra 25 units of stock as a safety buffer.

### Importance
- **Avoid Stockouts:** Helps in maintaining a smooth operation by preventing stockouts, which can lead to lost sales and unhappy customers.
- **Balance Costs:** While holding safety stock incurs holding costs, it helps avoid the potentially higher costs of stockouts, including lost sales and lower customer satisfaction.

Together, ROP and safety stock levels are crucial for effective inventory management, ensuring that there's enough stock to meet demand, while also minimizing the costs associated with holding too much inventory.





In the context of supply chains, a "push system" refers to a strategy where products are produced and pushed to customers based on forecasts or projections of demand, rather than actual demand. This approach contrasts with a "pull system," where production is driven by actual demand from customers. Let's break down how it works and what to notice:
